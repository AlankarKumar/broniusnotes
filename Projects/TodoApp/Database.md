## 📖 What is a NoSQL Database, Really?

At its core:

- A **NoSQL database** is a system that stores and retrieves data in a flexible, non-relational way (unlike SQL which uses fixed tables and schemas).
    
- Types: key-value store, document store, graph database, wide-column, etc.
    

You're essentially building a **data management engine** that can:

- Store data (usually as JSON-like objects)
    
- Retrieve data based on keys or queries
    
- Persist data to disk (optional for now — or start in-memory)
    
- Possibly support things like indexing, querying, filtering, and maybe relationships

## 📚 What You’ll Need to Learn

Here’s a breakdown of **concepts you should be comfortable with**:

### 1️⃣ Core Data Structures (Implemented in JavaScript)

- **Hash maps (objects, Maps)** → for key-value pair storage
    
- **Arrays** → for storing lists of documents
    
- **Trees** (optional, for indexing like B-Trees / Trie structures)
    
- **Linked lists** (if you’re optimizing write operations or caches)
    
- **Queues / Stacks** (for query execution pipelines or transactions)
    

### 2️⃣ Concepts & Algorithms

- **Serialization & Deserialization** (convert data to and from JSON, or custom formats)
    
- **Basic file I/O** (for persistence — `fs` module in Node.js)
    
- **Data indexing** (to quickly retrieve data based on certain fields)
    
- **Query parsing** (like parsing a filter object `{ age: { $gt: 20 } }`)
    
- **Data consistency models** (eventual consistency vs strict consistency)
    
- **Concurrency control** (if handling multiple operations simultaneously)
    

### 3️⃣ Optional Concepts (For Advanced Features)

- **Write-ahead logs / Journaling** (to prevent data loss)
    
- **Compaction / Garbage collection**
    
- **Caching strategies**
    
- **Query optimizations**
    
- **Transactions / Atomic operations**
