📖 What You Need to Learn to Build REST APIs with Pure Node.js
📌 1️⃣ Core Node.js Fundamentals

Before touching APIs, be fluent in:

    The Node.js event loop and non-blocking I/O.

    Modules (CommonJS vs ES modules).

    Built-in modules you’ll rely on:

        http

        url

        querystring

        fs

        path

        crypto

        stream

    Working with Buffers & Streams
    Useful for file uploads or large payload handling.

Node.js official docs: https://nodejs.org/en/docs
📌 2️⃣ Building an HTTP Server with the http Module

Learn how to:

    Create a server using http.createServer().

    Handle incoming requests and responses.

    Work with HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.

    Parse request URLs and query parameters.

    Parse request bodies (for POST, PUT).

        Text data

        JSON data

        Form-urlencoded data

    Set HTTP status codes and response headers.

👉 Example Concept:

const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.url === '/api' && req.method === 'GET') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
    res.end(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello World' }));
  }
});
server.listen(3000);

📌 3️⃣ Routing Logic (Manual)

Since no frameworks, you’ll have to:

    Build your own simple routing mechanism:

        Map URLs + HTTP methods to handlers.

        Example:
        { 'GET /users': getUsersHandler }

You can start with a simple object mapping, and later evolve to regex-based dynamic route matching.
📌 4️⃣ Request Body Parsing

For POST/PUT/PATCH:

    Learn how to handle incoming stream data.

    Collect the stream data chunks.

    Assemble and parse JSON or other content types.

👉 Things to know:

    How to handle data and end events on req.

    How to set a maximum payload size to prevent abuse.

📌 5️⃣ Error Handling

    Global server error handling.

    Custom error responses (404, 400, 500, etc.)

    Edge cases:

        Invalid JSON

        Route not found

        Unsupported methods

📌 6️⃣ Working with Files

If you need to persist data:

    Learn to use the fs module.

    Read and write JSON files.

    Handle concurrency issues (locks, overwrites, etc.)

Optional: You can later replace this with a database integration.
📌 7️⃣ HTTP Headers and Status Codes

Understand:

    Common HTTP status codes and when to use them.

    Content-Type headers (application/json, text/plain, etc.)

    CORS headers if handling requests from browsers.

    Custom headers if needed.

📌 8️⃣ Environment Variables

Use environment variables (via process.env) for:

    Port numbers

    Secret keys

    Database URLs (if any)

Optionally, learn to use the dotenv package for local development, though you could roll your own basic config loader too.
📌 9️⃣ Security Basics

Even simple APIs need basic security awareness:

    Validate and sanitize inputs.

    Limit request body size.

    Set proper HTTP headers (CORS, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)

    Rate limiting (optional — can be implemented with counters in-memory)

📌 🔟 Asynchronous Programming

Master:

    Promises

    Async/Await

    Error handling in asynchronous code (try/catch, .catch() chains)

📌 1️⃣1️⃣ API Design Principles (RESTful)

Understand how to properly design REST APIs:

    Use correct HTTP methods for actions.

    Resource-oriented URLs:

        GET /users

        POST /users

        GET /users/:id

        DELETE /users/:id

    Proper use of status codes and error messages.

    Consistent response structures.

📌 1️⃣2️⃣ Testing the API

Use tools like:

    Postman

    cURL

    httpie

For manual API testing, debugging, and iterating.
📌 1️⃣3️⃣ Optional: Add a Database

If you plan to persist data beyond flat files:

    Learn how to connect to a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.) using native drivers (no ORMs like Sequelize or Mongoose).

    Manage database connections and queries manually.

📌 1️⃣4️⃣ Logging

Implement basic logging:

    Log incoming requests

    Log errors and unhandled rejections

    Possibly log to a file using fs or use external log monitoring services

📌 1️⃣5️⃣ Deploying

Understand how to:

    Start your server on a remote server (like a VPS)

    Use a process manager (like pm2) to keep it running.

    Handle environment configs in production.

📌 1️⃣6️⃣ Versioning APIs (Optional)

For larger applications:

    Learn how to handle URL versioning (/api/v1/users)

    Or manage via headers (Accept: application/vnd.myapp.v1+json)

📌 Bonus: Organizing Code

Eventually, you'll want to split your code into:

    server.js

    routes/

    controllers/

    utils/

    data/ or db/

    middlewares/ (if you build your own)
