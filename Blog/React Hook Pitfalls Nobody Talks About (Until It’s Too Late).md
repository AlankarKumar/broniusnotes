*If you're not sure you should be reading this through or investing time understanding hooks better, here's some motivation for you.*

*I came across this because when the Order Success Page stopped loading on a large scale e-commerce webapp on a black friday sale.* 

*Reason - Race condition in useEffect hook.* 

> Hooks look simple. Hooks pretend to be simple. Hooks are the kind of friend who seems chill until you realize they’ve got a conspiracy wall in their basement. 

Everyone learns useState and useEffect in 10 minutes and thinks, “Cool, I’m a React dev now.”
But in production, they start behaving like tiny chaos gremlins.

*Let’s unpack why.*

## 🪄 The Illusion of Simplicity

**React’s sales pitch was:**

>     “No more classes! No more this keyword! It’s just functions now. Clean, pure, innocent functions.”

And that’s true — until you have:

    - Multiple effects relying on each other.

    - Async events to clean up.

    - Weird bugs from stale closures that make you question your life choices.

**The API is clean.**
**The consequences? Not so much.**

## 🧠 React’s Render Cycle with Hooks — How it Actually Works

**Quick version:**

>     Render phase: React runs your component like a normal function. All Hooks register themselves in order.
> 
>     Commit phase: DOM updates.
> 
>     Post-commit:
> 
>         useLayoutEffect runs synchronously (block render).
> 
>         useEffect runs asynchronously after paint.

And here’s the trick:
Each effect’s cleanup runs before its next execution or on unmount.

## 📊 Visual Summary:

```
[Render] → [Commit DOM] → [useLayoutEffect (sync)] → [useEffect (async)]
             |                                    |
             |                                    +-- side effects start
             +-- function body runs, Hooks register

```
> Bonus: No, React does not guarantee the order of multiple useEffects in the same render. Another plot twist.

## ⚠️ What Actually Happens When…


### 🎯 You have multiple effects depending on each other?

***✋🏻🛑⛔️ Bad idea.***
> Splitting interdependent logic across multiple `useEffects` is like trying to cook a meal in four different kitchens at the same time.

**Problem:**
React doesn’t promise when those effects will run relative to one another within the same phase. You’ll get race conditions or weird bugs where one effect depends on state that hasn’t updated yet.

Bad Example:
```jsx
useEffect(() => { setData(fetchData()); }, []);`
useEffect(() => { if (data) doSomething(data); }, [data]);

```

**Fix:**
Combine them or use a custom hook:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const result = fetchData();
  setData(result);
  doSomething(result);
}, []);
```

Clean, predictable, drama-free.

### 👻 You need to unsubscribe from async events reliably?

***Welcome to Memory Leak City if you forget your cleanups.***

**Bad:**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  socket.on('message', handleMessage);
}, []);
```

**Why it sucks:**
You never remove the listener. It stays forever. Ghost listeners haunting your app.

**Good:**

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  socket.on('message', handleMessage);
  return () => socket.off('message', handleMessage);
}, []);
```


### ☢️  Dependency Array Disasters

***You think you know the dependency array. You don’t.***

Imagine a pet-feeding app that shows your cat’s hunger status.
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (catMood === 'hangry') {
    console.log('Better feed the beast!');
  }
}, []);  // Oops, catMood isn't a dependency
```

**❌ Problem: The effect will never rerun when catMood changes. Now the cat's smashing your keyboard and your effect doesn’t care.**

### 🕰️ Stale Closures: The Time machine

**The Problem:**
Values inside effects "freeze" the moment the effect is created. If a value changes later, tough luck — the effect won’t know.

**Classic Mistake:**
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const id = setInterval(() => {
    console.log(count); // Stale value 😬
  }, 1000);
}, []);
```


**Fix:**
Use refs for mutable values:
```jsx
const countRef = useRef(count);
useEffect(() => {
  countRef.current = count;
}, [count]);

```

Now, your interval will always see the latest value via `countRef.current`

Dependency array chaos?

    Forgetting a dep = stale values.

    Adding too many deps = infinite loops.

> ***Use react-hooks/exhaustive-deps ESLint rule. Not negotiable.***

### 👾Effects Doing Too Much

***An effect should be like a good pizza: few quality ingredients. If your useEffect is doing state updates, fetching data, attaching event listeners, and managing setTimeouts all at once — you’ve built a monster.***

### 🗿 useMemo and useCallback — The Most Misunderstood Hooks in React

You know what’s harder than using React Hooks? Using `useMemo` and `useCallback` correctly.

These two Hooks exist to "*optimize*" things, but most devs sprinkle them around like parsley on bad pasta, hoping it improves performance.
***Spoiler: it usually doesn't. And sometimes, it makes things worse.***

#### 🥸 useMemo — Caching, But Not The Way You Think

**What people think it does:**
“Memoizes my calculation so it never re-runs.”

**What it actually does:**
“Memoizes your calculation until one of the dependencies changes. Then it re-runs.”

Also: It only helps if the calculation is genuinely expensive.
**If it takes 0.002 milliseconds, congratulations — you just made your code harder to read for no gain.**

##### 🔥 Pro Pattern:

**Use it when:**

- The calculation is slow (think: sorting huge lists, complex math, recursive doom) 
- The component re-renders frequently



Example:

```jsx
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => slowFunction(data), [data]);
```

What not to do:

```jsx
const memoizedName = useMemo(() => 'John Doe', []);
```

**💀 That literally does nothing. Congrats, you made React work harder for no reason.**


#### 🤯 useCallback — The Memoized Function You Don’t Need 80% of the Time

**What people think it does:**
“Prevents my function from being recreated on every render.”

**What it actually does:**
“Prevents the function reference from changing between renders — but only matters if that reference is being passed to a child component that’s using React.memo or a dependency in another useEffect/useMemo.”

***If none of those apply, you just complicated your code for nothing.***

##### 🔥 Pro Pattern:

Use it when:

    Passing a function to a memoized child (React.memo)

    Using it inside a useEffect/useMemo dependency array

    It closes over stable dependencies you care about

**Example:**

```jsx
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  console.log('Clicked!');
}, []);

```

**Misuse Example:**

```jsx
const logName = useCallback(() => console.log('Sam'), []);
```

*Unless you’re passing this to a memoized child or a dep array — why? Why would you do this? You don’t need this.*

#### ⚠️ The Real Pitfall: The Illusion of Optimization

Both Hooks have a cost:

    Tracking dependencies

    Caching values/functions

    Comparing dependencies deeply (object refs, etc.)

So if your code doesn’t actually benefit from this caching, you just added overhead for no reason.

##### 👉 Pro Rule of Thumb:

> If you can’t measure a performance gain in the React DevTools profiler, you don’t need useMemo or useCallback.

#### 📊 Quick Decision Table:

| Situation                                    | Use `useMemo`? | Use `useCallback`? |
|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------|:------------------|
| Heavy calculation, runs on every render      | ✅              | ❌                 |
| Passing functions to `React.memo` child      | ❌              | ✅                 |
| Simple state updates                         | ❌              | ❌                 |
| Functions inside effects/memo hooks          | ❌              | ✅                 |
| Small string constants                       | ❌              | ❌                 |



##### 🎁 Pro Tip:

> **If you’re unsure whether to use useCallback, ask yourself:**
> **"Is this function causing a child to unnecessarily re-render or affecting a dep array?"**
> **If the answer is no — delete it. Save a tree. 🌳**




# 🔥 The Takeaway

***These are non-obvious operational pitfalls that:***

    ***Don't show up in small demo apps.***

    ***Will hunt you down in production.***

***Real mastery of Hooks is learning to anticipate these side effects of side effects.***
