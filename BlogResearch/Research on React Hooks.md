1. Accidental Infinite Loops 
2. Forgetting to clean up side effects
3. Non-primitive values in dep array

2. Managing multiple useEffect Hooks
3. Avoiding Race Conditions in async operations. 


Advanced Patterns 

These are patterns you would ultimately developed or would have developed or maybe you've seen it and not realised or thought why its done that way.
