## 📌 About

I’m a **Full Stack Developer** with **9+ years of experience** crafting **scalable, performant, and accessible web applications**. My toolkit includes **React**, **Angular**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, and cloud-native architectures built on **AWS** and **Azure** — because what’s life without a little serverless magic and a few Lambda functions firing at odd hours?

Over the years, I’ve worked on **high-impact projects** ranging from dynamic, data-driven dashboards to enterprise-grade eCommerce platforms. My obsession with **clean architecture**, **design systems**, and **pixel-perfect, accessible UIs** means I’m often the one in code reviews nagging about “consistent button padding” — and proud of it.

I’m passionate about **design systems, component libraries, and frontend performance optimization**. As a **Figma practitioner** with a love for UX, I enjoy teaming up with designers to transform wireframes into **accessible, elegant, and production-ready interfaces**.

When I’m not building production systems, I’m busy with personal projects like:
- An **open-source eCommerce Design System** (React + Storybook + TypeScript)
- A **White-Label Commerce Platform** powered by Angular, Node.js, and AWS

I also run a **tech blog** where I talk about **frontend architecture, React and Angular best practices, clean code patterns, design system strategy**, and occasionally rant about why *spaghetti code belongs in Italian kitchens, not production systems.*

Outside of code, you’ll likely find me chasing sunrises with my **camera and motorcycle**, debating sci-fi movie plot holes, or planning my next hiking escape to unplug and reboot my brain.

Always up for a chat about **frontend patterns, open-source, design systems, performance engineering, or the eternal React vs Angular debate** (spoiler: I love both).

**Let’s connect and build something awesome.**
