üìñ Foundations to Know Before You Start

    HTML5

        Semantic HTML

        Forms, inputs, and validations

        History API (for routing)

    CSS3

        Layout: Flexbox & CSS Grid

        Animations & Transitions

        Custom Properties (CSS variables)

        Media Queries (for responsiveness)

    JavaScript (ES6+)

        Modules (import / export)

        Arrow functions, template literals, destructuring

        Promises, async/await

        Classes & Prototypes

        Fetch API / XMLHttpRequest

        DOM manipulation and events

        Event delegation (for dynamic elements)

        Closures, callbacks, and higher-order functions

üèóÔ∏è Core SPA Architecture Concepts

    Routing System

        Hash-based routing (window.location.hash)

        History API-based routing (history.pushState, popstate event)

        Mapping URL patterns to components/views

    Component System

        Reusable UI component creation (via JS classes or factory functions)

        Encapsulation of logic and templates

        State-driven rendering

        Component lifecycle management (init, mount, update, destroy)

    State Management

        Centralized state store (like Redux without Redux)

        Observer pattern or pub/sub system

        Immutable updates (e.g. with object/array spread)

        State-driven UI rendering

    Templating

        String interpolation (template literals)

        Minimalistic virtual DOM or DOM diffing

        Rendering dynamic content efficiently

üì° Data Handling

    Fetching data via fetch or XMLHttpRequest

    Handling JSON APIs

    Error handling and retries

    Loading states and spinners

    Caching or local storage for data persistence

    Forms submission and client-side validation

üß≠ Navigation & Deep Linking

    Handling internal navigation without page reloads

    Active link highlighting

    Fallback routes (404 pages)

    Bookmarkable and shareable URLs

    Nested routes if needed

üé® UX & UI Essentials

    Smooth page transitions and animations

    Custom modals, tooltips, dropdowns

    Keyboard and accessibility handling

    Mobile-first design and responsive layouts

üõ°Ô∏è Security

    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention

    Sanitizing user inputs and dynamic HTML

    Secure data fetching (CORS, HTTPS APIs)

    CSP headers awareness (if you‚Äôre deploying)

‚öôÔ∏è Tooling & Build Process

    Bundling: Use Vite, Parcel, or roll your own with ES modules (optional but recommended)

    Linting: ESLint

    Testing:

        Unit tests with Jest (optional in vanilla)

        Manual testing strategy for components

    Version Control: Git

    Dev Server: A simple local server (e.g. live-server, or a tiny Node.js server)

üì¶ Optional Extras for a More Robust SPA

    Service Workers (for offline support)

    Local Storage / Session Storage for caching

    Intersection Observer for infinite scroll / lazy loading

    Drag & Drop API

    Clipboard API

    WebSockets for real-time updates

    Web Animations API (for high-performance animations)

Step 5: Build a simple router
Step 6: Handle data fetching with Fetch API
Step 7: Connect everything into a proper SPA architecture
Step 8: Optimize for UX, accessibility, and security
Step 9: Learn simple tooling for bundling and testing
Step 10: Iterate and polish
