I’ve stripped markdown formatting and cleaned it for pure text readability.

### About

I’m a Full Stack Developer with 9+ years of experience crafting scalable, performant, and accessible web applications. My toolkit includes React, Angular, TypeScript, Node.js, and cloud-native architectures built on AWS and Azure — because what’s life without a little serverless magic and a few Lambda functions firing at odd hours?

Over the years, I’ve worked on high-impact projects ranging from dynamic, data-driven dashboards to enterprise-grade eCommerce platforms. My obsession with clean architecture, design systems, and pixel-perfect, accessible UIs means I’m often the one in code reviews nagging about “consistent button padding” — and proud of it.

I’m passionate about design systems, component libraries, and frontend performance optimization. As a Figma practitioner with a love for UX, I enjoy teaming up with designers to transform wireframes into accessible, elegant, and production-ready interfaces.

When I’m not building production systems, I’m busy with personal projects like:

* An open-source eCommerce Design System (React + Storybook + TypeScript)
* A White-Label Commerce Platform powered by Angular, Node.js, and AWS

I also run a tech blog where I talk about frontend architecture, React and Angular best practices, clean code patterns, design system strategy, and occasionally rant about why spaghetti code belongs in Italian kitchens, not production systems.

Outside of code, you’ll likely find me chasing sunrises with my camera and motorcycle, debating sci-fi movie plot holes, or planning my next hiking escape to unplug and reboot my brain.

Always up for a chat about frontend patterns, open-source, design systems, performance engineering, or the eternal React vs Angular debate (spoiler: I love both).

Let’s connect and build something awesome.
